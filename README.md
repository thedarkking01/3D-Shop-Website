# 3D Shop Website

Welcome to the 3D Shop Website project! This project is a dynamic 3D e-commerce platform built using **ReactJS**, **Three.js**, and **Canvas Technology**. The website showcases products in a 3D interactive environment, allowing users to explore items in a visually immersive way.

---

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Shop**: Users can interact with products in 3D, rotating and zooming to view details.
- **ReactJS-based UI**: The website is built using ReactJS to ensure a fast and smooth user interface.
- **Three.js for 3D Visualization**: Products are rendered and displayed using Three.js, creating a real-time interactive 3D environment.
- **Canvas Technology**: Utilizes HTML5 Canvas to display the 3D models and animations for the shopping experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout and interactions adapt to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the website's front-end structure.
- **Three.js**: A 3D JavaScript library that provides powerful tools for creating 3D content within the browser.
- **Canvas API**: HTML5 Canvas to render 3D objects and create interactive scenes.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and layout for the website’s interface.
- **Node.js**: Back-end server for hosting and managing resources (optional, depending on your project setup).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thedarkking01/3D-Shop-Website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-shop-website
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
